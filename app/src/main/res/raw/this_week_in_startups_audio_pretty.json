      "summary": "Rose Broome was walking down the street in San Francisco when she noticed a homeless woman living on the street. She thought, there must be a service to help people in need get crucial items like food and personal hygiene products, with some amount of transparency. When she couldn't find one, she founded HandUp. The for-profit benefit corporation partners with local charities and city services to get more aid directly to homeless and poor people in San Francisco. People in need - members - join HandUp and can create a personal profile on their website. Donors can read individual stories, or give to people they meet in the city via SMS or from the site. Broome isn't only civically-minded. She's ambitious. With progressively minded technologists in the Bay Area looking for ways to give, a large needy population, and millions of dollars in government aid issued in the form of debit cards, she sees HandUp as a tool to solve homelessness through a for-profit venture. Think: a privately-run Food Stamps or SNAP program. Jason gets excited about tackling the seemingly insurmountable issue of homelessness, and how maybe charity isn't enough. Stay tuned for a surprise at the end."

Advertising and virtual goods. No one knows user numbers. Interesting: 70% of users are women\r\n3:55 - JC what do you think, CA? Is this out of line?\r\n4:05 - CA: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stopped guessing at valuations. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard of Snapchat before, but just barely, and because I have kids.\r\n4:35 - JC These things get very big, very quick today.\r\n4:49 - CF: they should take the money and run!\r\n5:30 - When you sold OMGPop, did you feel it was the biggest you could get?\r\n5:48 - CF: We were #1, and where do you go from there? You just go down\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.maybe that large investment from teens, is taking value out of Facebook\r\n6:44 - JC: Chris, having been the editor of Wired for a long time, do you have inner tells on things like that?\r\n7:05 - I was an early user of Twitter, but I was wrong about that. I don't think anyone can tell if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustainable, or if teenage fickleness is going to move on?\r\n7:33 - JC: Spotify is reporting $600M in revenue (vs Pandora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s). \u00c2 What do you think?\r\n7:53 - CA - the licensing deals, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got apps on all platforms, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sophisticated cloud service.\r\n8:22 - CF: I use it; I love it. Engineer friends are going to use those subs to explore other opportunities for revenue. \u00c2 Video, etc. Extreme brand loyalty to the people who use it.\r\n11:00 - 12:05 - JC: Chris, why did you leave Wired?\r\n12:30 - CA: It boils down to Follow your heart. But I started messing around with Lego Mindstorm with my kids. They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed with walking or rolling robots. What if they could fly? They lost interest, but I started a community called DIY Drones. \u00c2 The 2007 period is when sensors became super cheap. The community grew; people shared design files. The open source model could build a drone. I was having my kids pack kits into pizza companies.\r\n14:25 - JC: can you describe these? When you think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Drone,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 you think military drone.\r\n14:45 - CA we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had radio controlled aircraft for decades. Shows quadcopter & octocopter. \u00c2 They have autopilot, which means they fly themselves. Difference between radio control and UAM and fully autonomous drones. Only been possible over the past few years - smartphone technology.\r\n15:42 - JC: Charles?\r\n"

      "summary": "It's starting to seem like Google wins at everything. (For more on that, see Jason's recent editorial (http:\/\/blog.launch.co\/blog\/googlewinseverything-part-1.html)). They're jumping into the smart watch contest, with a model due to arrive in the next few months, and just revealed that mysterious barges off San Francisco Bay and Portland, Maine are not floating data centers. Instead, they're showrooms for Google X projects. In other words, party barges. The NSA is still trying to spoil the party, however. The latest revelation from the Washington Post, drawing on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, shows the NSA attacked servers that link up data centers owned by Google and Yahoo. That's on top of limited front-door access the agency has negotiated with internet giants. And the Launch of the Week, brought to you by Bing! Motorola teams up with Phonebloks on modular phones. An affordable desktop 3D printer raised $3m on Kickstarter. And aircraft manufacturer Aerion is planning a supersonic business jet.

Now, he invests in companies and advises other young entrepreneurs to have fun, make money, and do good on the internet. When he sat down with Jason in New York City, Alexis talked about the wonder of a multimillion dollar exit at age 23, avoiding censorship on reddit, and how tech leaders need to step up to politics in an era of SOPA, PIPA and NSA intrusions into privacy.

Where for instance, are you spending that's not really leading to sales? Mat Ellis started Cloudability as a freelance project between gigs, as a weekly email: here's what you on spent on the cloud, and how it was allocated. Now you can use the dashboard to dig deep into daily fluctuations. Mat says customers report spending 20% less in the first month, once they get a true idea of where they're money is really going. And then they spend smarter. Jason talked to Mat at TechStars Foundercon and called him \"the Ricky Gervais of startups.\""

One of Coursera's cofounders, Daphne Koller, is a computer scientist at Stanford, who until recently, was best known for her research on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Coursera, however, is about human learning. The platform makes classes at the nation's top universities available online, to anyone, for free. Students can earn certificates, and the company is working toward translating those certificates into course credit, that can be transferred into degree-seeking programs. In the meantime, with keyboard biometrics and detailed logging of each click, Coursera plans to use its troves of data to better understand how people learn. Within 5 years, Koller says, Coursera will have the curriculum of a medium to large university.  From LAUNCH Education & Kids, check out this fantastic interview."

I love learning and having great guests. One of the products that I use in my companies, all of my companies is New Relic. New Relic is the most awesome web and mobile app monitoring system. It makes all of your apps so much faster because it monitors to real time user experience. Here, you see it on my screen. I may just pull it up here. You can see the browser load time based upon the page rendering, and the network, and the web application, and the request queuing, and memory cache. How is the database doing? How is Ruby doing? If things are out of whack, and you have a hundred millisecond delay, I get these automatic emails to me, and I just hit reply. The team is on it. I am, \"What's going on?\" You could do code level, app performance, as you see here. Which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute? What percentage of the time? What is the response time like? How much of the CPU we are using? All great stuff to know. This really brings this responsiveness. Remember, Marissa Mayer and all the Google team were, \"Speed is the best feature! Speed is the best feature! If you add speed, you increase usage.\" Increase speed, reduce lag - increase usage. Just make it faster, people use it more. Everybody knows that. It is just 101. But you need to have the tools. And you know what? Leaving in the hands of just a sysadmin, and not having this kind of tools, you need to have a collaborative environment about this. That is what I love about, getting resources to send by email. Everybody can see it. You can obviously monitor server resources too. You can see, \"Oh! This server that is running Ubuntu, gets this much RAM, and this type of CPU. Here is how it is doing. Here is the network I\/O card. Maybe something is wrong with a pop. Something is wrong with the router.\" We were going to know quickly. They have got 40k customers, and it includes just everybody: Skullcandy, Spotify, Nike, Zillow, and Vonage. I mean these are the people running very large websites. They are relying on New Relic to keep them optimized. Developers across the spectrum trust their critical performance to New Relic. If you want a super powered visibility into all of your web and mobile apps, sign up today, and you will get a free \"This Week in Startups\" T-shirt. Just go to NewRelic.com\/TWIST. When you go to NewRelic.com\/TWIST, you just click, and you will get this free fan made T-shirt. It has a samurai sword there. I am always saying,"
