This is Startups for the Rest of Us: Episode 183.\r\n[00:09] Music\r\n[00:18] Welcome to Startups for the Rest of Us, the podcast that helps developers, designers and entrepreneurs be awesome at launching software products, whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built your first product or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just thinking about it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Rob.\r\n[00:26] Mike: And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Mike.\r\n[00:27] Rob: And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the word this week Mike?\r\n[00:32] Mike: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m experimenting a little bit with some various bio hacks to help improve my overall health. Some things are just basic things like just going to the gym on a very regular basis but some of them are I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say a little bit out there and so far though it seems to be working. There are certain things that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noticed for example. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working less hours and it feels like I should pull back on spending time working out but at the same time I recognize that if I do that then what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen is I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to spend those additional hours working on my products and stuff but at the same time, my productivity is going to drop. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this weird state where I know in the back of my mind that I really shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do that but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like I want to.\r\n[01:16] Rob: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a little confused. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working less hours by choice and that makes you feel like you should workout less?\r\n[01:21] Mike: No. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working less hours and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m spending that time instead working out.\r\n[01:26] Rob: I see.\r\n[01:27] Mike: So in the back of my mind I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m like I wish I had more time to work on this stuff. Where can I get that time from? and the natural place to get it from would be to stop working out.\r\n[01:37] Rob: Exercise.\r\n[01:38] Mike: Exactly. Exercise. But I know that if I do that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to negatively impact my productivity when I am working.\r\n[01:42] Rob: When you are working, right.\r\n[01:42] Mike: And the other thing, my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fitness instructor so she actually put together one of the workout routines for me and I tried it out and afterwards I gave her a call and I was like I think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to kill me because that was really rough. And she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have possibly been that bad and then she tried it and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like sorry.\r\n[02:00] Rob: Nice. She was trying to kill you.\r\n[02:04] Mike: I think so.\r\n[02:06] Rob: Hey, I have a couple things this week. The first is a congratulations to a three time MicroConf attendee, his name\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robert Grzesek and he writes software that controls mills which are little wood - well sometimes they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very large but sometimes smaller, things that cut wood to make cabinets and to do really intricate cuts and he said that they take in the software, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been doing it full time for years. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken it as far as they could so they decided to actually launch their own mill to build some hardware. So we launched a kick starter and they wanted $30,000 and it was funded the first day. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now a $61,000 and they have 29 days to go still as the recording of this podcast. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll link it up in the show notes or you can also search on the Nomad CNC mill. So check it out for sure and congratulations to Robert for getting that up on kick starter.\r\n[02:56] The other announcement from the community is Brennan Dunn is going to be on Edinburgh in Scotland in June. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be talking at the Our theme music is an excerpt from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Outta Control\u00e2\u20ac\u009d by MoOt used under Creative Commons. disruption and publishing conference on June 20th. Brennan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also looking at putting together a workshop about online marketing and starting a business so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested, if you know Brennan and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the Edinburgh area, I would recommend that you drop him an email at brennan@planscope.io and let him know that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122r[...]"

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Mike.\r\n[00:19] Rob: And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Rob.\r\n[00:20] Mike: And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made. How you doing this week, Rob?\r\n[00:24] Rob: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing good. I feel like the new year is really starting to ramp up and people are back signing up for apps again and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exciting.\r\n[00:33] Mike: Yeah, I know what you mean. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a number of things that were on my list of things to get done last year that never did but they tended to be more of the clean up nature and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve starting to bang through those kind of get them off of my mind and off my plates so that I can work on other things.\r\n[00:46] Rob: Yeah, I had several of those as well. I also finally did my 2-day retreat just to do some thinking. You know, I walked like miles and miles a day and thought and looked at my goals for 2013 and how I wanted to accomplish those and what was going to take. And I looked both at for personal and professional and I just thought through them in-depth. I did mapped them out in quite a bit of detail in a bulleted list and then I put them in to my idea notebook where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be referencing them throughout the year. It was a really good way to start the year actually. I recommend if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6can take even just 24 hours and get away from kind of the hectic nature of your life to really sit down and think about what you want to accomplish in the year. I found it to be pretty valuable.\r\n[01:25] Mike: Cool.\r\n[01:25] Rob: How about you, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on?\r\n[01:26] Mike: So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the middle of finalizing things for releasing AuditShark to someone of my early access customers next week and I plan on giving them to access to everything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been built so far. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve touched based with the couple of them but not nearly as many as I would like to. So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something I need to work on a little bit more but fortunately, the contractors that I have doing some of the development work, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been just concentrating on the technical side of things which freeze up a lot of my time for all the marketing stuff and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going really well right now. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really happy with all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on. Hopefully, the trend will continue and my previously stated goal, I was thinking about it last night of not doing code. I decided I have to retract that just because I enjoy doing code on occasion. I think kind of touching things on occasion as opposed to digging in and actually trying to solve some of the down or dirty problems.\r\n[02:19] Rob: Yeah, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big difference between coding on major projects and just hacking your script out because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m like you. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get away from the code because I enjoy it too much. I really do love writing good code. It gives your mind a rest if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re busy thinking about, you know, a lot of other stuff. So you just sit there and code for an hour or two can be pretty enjoyable. So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m with you. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll ever get away from it and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really, really have the desire to. But getting away from having to do it 10, 20, 30 hours a week, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely I can see that as an admirable goal.\r\n[02:50] Mike: Uh huh.\r\n[02:50] Rob: So, other stuff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6other stuff that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new with me, is with HitTail I have three small launches plan for the next probably 14 days. We have an info graphic that was ready in December and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about long tail SEO, trying to get some Twitter buzz and you know, wherever else it is, you do with an info graphic to generate some interest. And then we integrated with HubSpot which is a pretty big one for us. So, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be talking to them trying to get the yeses, that integration marketing thing I keep talking about or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like you integrate with folk[...]"

What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the word this week, Mike?\r\n[00:29] Mike: Well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in Canada.\r\n[00:31] Rob: Canada. Vancouver?\r\n[00:32] Mike: Nope. Calgary to be exact.\r\n[00:34] Rob: Awesome. Is it chilly up there?\r\n[00:34] Mike: Not too bad. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 40\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s or 50\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2s right now.\r\n[00:38] Rob: Oh cool. Yeah, I got a couple of things I wanted to revisit. I was actually listening to episode 75 which is two episodes ago. And remember we had a question about someone was thinking about starting an idea that with $99 a month and it was catering to retailers with closed out merchandise?\r\n[00:53] Mike: Yeah, I remember that.\r\n[00:55] Rob: And we were kind of butting ideas back and forth about it and I was listening to that I realized why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t we suggest to really differentiate because I was trying to think why would this idea any different than Craigslist. Why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t retail and put the stuff on eBay and the way that he would have to penetrate this market I think would be to hire someone or do it themselves for the first few months. Hire someone to go on site and actually snap the photos and post the stuff for free. And now would be to differentiate or write a new B up to X items per month for 99 bucks and then a B X dollars for each additional one or you could have it to your plan as well. But I just realized that like that could actually be a differentiator, right. The reason they would keep them from putting their stuff on Craigslist or eBay is just purely the labor aspect of it.\r\n[01:39] Mike: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad idea because then you could charge them to essentially come on site and do that stuff for them but then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re introducing a labor component on your own side.\r\n[01:48] Rob: I know. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of manners. I mean it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scale that well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitely not like a super highly scalable business.\r\n[01:55] Mike: You know what? I think you could probably use it to target people who are in the photo industry who are hard up for work and just try and get them to go do this jobs on your behalf and obviously, they have to upload the photos and enter stuff in to your software but you could pay them by the hour and how long could it possibly take to do 25 or 50 items because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re charging more for more items than, you know, you could certainly use that to judge what your cost are especially in that startup test.\r\n[02:22] Rob: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saying almost like crowd source that like just have a kind of a work force piece may work force out there or job goes out and people can claim it and go do it rather than have someone that you or even a contract that you have on staff. Just kind of have photographers, people who know how to take pictures out, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing it.\r\n[02:36] Mike: Yeah, a little bit of both. I think initially you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to do it yourself or have somebody that you trust do it because then you can kind of work out the bugs in that process and then once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve kindly got that down, then you could essentially crowd source that work out to people and then pay them that way.\r\n[02:52] Rob: Right. So, cool. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if still the economics work in 99 bucks a month but anyways, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just another two cents on that. By the way, people are wondering whether call quality is going to crummy because you have a crappy wireless at the [...]"

Whether you have built your first product or you are just thinking about it, I am Rob.\r\n[00:21] Mike: And I am Mike.\r\n[00:23] Rob: And we are here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made. If you stick around to the end of the episode we are going to be discussing hiring and managing remote developers in depth. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on this week Mike?\r\n[00:35] Mike: The last week I remember you would you had mentioned that Google Adwords issue where if you go in you browse and you search for different things there was a little newsletter popup for somebody to signup directly through the Google Adwords. And I did some research on that and unfortunately it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in beta but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s basically just an Adwords extension that they have added on it. I mean they have added a couple of different Adwords extensions over the years and this is just one that is currently in beta. So I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much info on it and you know there is a little bit of speculation here and there but it seems to be rather new its only been out there for maybe a moth or so.\r\n[01:10] Rob: Yeah I have never actually seen it in the wild you are the one that stumbled upon it when we were having kind of an offline conversation. Explain to the\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about it at all on the podcast last week, explain to the listeners what it is.\r\n[01:20] Mike: So when you go to Google and you do a search for something that Google does is in addition to showing the page search results right underneath well actually its embedded in line with some of the search results that are paid for you will have a just a text field that says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubscribe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And there is a button off to the side I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether you can customize the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsubscribe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 button or not and you basically it will fill in your email address if you are already logged into Google services. And I will assume that it goes through and you know signs you up for whatever mailing list that they have.\r\n[01:55] Now if I remember correctly it also directly sends your email address to them. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if there is any sort of double opt in or anything like that but it looked interesting. The one thing I question is whether or not people are going to actively hand out their email address through something on that unless you explicitly say in the text of the Ad that you are giving something away for free and they can only get it if they sign up.\r\n[02:20] Rob:\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2  Yeah it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to be a big you are basically selling to them in like what you have 50 characters or something. I mean that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like ten words tops you know. So you really have to convince someone to give their email quickly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like you have even a sidebar with a little photo or anything like that its just very very tight. So we will see how it goes I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an interesting experiment obviously but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be curious to try it out at some point. And its Adwords only I mean you know its kind of a bummer they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow it in the search results. But I am sure they are going to they are not going to allow people to do that they want you to pay for it. Well hey my update the new Hit Tail design is up, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s live.\r\n[02:56] Mike: Really?\r\n[02:57] Rob:\u00c2 \u00c2 \u00c2  Yeah, yeas I launched it yesterday. So everyone rush out to hittail.com and check it out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of work. Try to think I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have nearly as many issues as I thought it would once I rolled it live. Because I have I did it kind of a commando launch you know I did not have the massive QA team doing all kinds of monitoring and all of that stuff. I just kind of I knew it worked pretty well and I tested the major functions. I put it up yesterday, I emailed everybody all the active users and said come check out and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\r\n[03:24] Mike: Cool.\r\n[03:25] [...]"
