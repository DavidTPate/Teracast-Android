This is Startups for the Rest of Us: Episode 183.\r\n[00:09] Music\r\n[00:18] Welcome to Startups for the Rest of Us, the podcast that helps developers, designers and entrepreneurs be awesome at launching software products, whether youâ€™ve built your first product or youâ€™re just thinking about it. Iâ€™m Rob.\r\n[00:26] Mike: And Iâ€™m Mike.\r\n[00:27] Rob: And weâ€™re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes weâ€™ve made. Whatâ€™s the word this week Mike?\r\n[00:32] Mike: Iâ€™m experimenting a little bit with some various bio hacks to help improve my overall health. Some things are just basic things like just going to the gym on a very regular basis but some of them are Iâ€™ll say a little bit out there and so far though it seems to be working. There are certain things that Iâ€™ve noticed for example. Iâ€™m working less hours and it feels like I should pull back on spending time working out but at the same time I recognize that if I do that then whatâ€™s going to happen is Iâ€™m going to spend those additional hours working on my products and stuff but at the same time, my productivity is going to drop. So itâ€™s this weird state where I know in the back of my mind that I really shouldnâ€™t do that but itâ€™s like I want to.\r\n[01:16] Rob: Iâ€™m a little confused. Youâ€™re working less hours by choice and that makes you feel like you should workout less?\r\n[01:21] Mike: No. Iâ€™m working less hours and Iâ€™m spending that time instead working out.\r\n[01:26] Rob: I see.\r\n[01:27] Mike: So in the back of my mind Iâ€™m like I wish I had more time to work on this stuff. Where can I get that time from? and the natural place to get it from would be to stop working out.\r\n[01:37] Rob: Exercise.\r\n[01:38] Mike: Exactly. Exercise. But I know that if I do that, itâ€™s going to negatively impact my productivity when I am working.\r\n[01:42] Rob: When you are working, right.\r\n[01:42] Mike: And the other thing, my wifeâ€™s a fitness instructor so she actually put together one of the workout routines for me and I tried it out and afterwards I gave her a call and I was like I think youâ€™re trying to kill me because that was really rough. And sheâ€™s like it couldnâ€™t have possibly been that bad and then she tried it and sheâ€™s like sorry.\r\n[02:00] Rob: Nice. She was trying to kill you.\r\n[02:04] Mike: I think so.\r\n[02:06] Rob: Hey, I have a couple things this week. The first is a congratulations to a three time MicroConf attendee, his nameâ€™s Robert Grzesek and he writes software that controls mills which are little wood - well sometimes theyâ€™re very large but sometimes smaller, things that cut wood to make cabinets and to do really intricate cuts and he said that they take in the software, heâ€™s been doing it full time for years. Theyâ€™ve taken it as far as they could so they decided to actually launch their own mill to build some hardware. So we launched a kick starter and they wanted $30,000 and it was funded the first day. Theyâ€™re now a $61,000 and they have 29 days to go still as the recording of this podcast. Weâ€™ll link it up in the show notes or you can also search on the Nomad CNC mill. So check it out for sure and congratulations to Robert for getting that up on kick starter.\r\n[02:56] The other announcement from the community is Brennan Dunn is going to be on Edinburgh in Scotland in June. Heâ€™s going to be talking at the Our theme music is an excerpt from â€œWeâ€™re Outta Controlâ€ by MoOt used under Creative Commons. disruption and publishing conference on June 20th. Brennanâ€™s also looking at putting together a workshop about online marketing and starting a business so if youâ€™re interested, if you know Brennan and youâ€™re in the Edinburgh area, I would recommend that you drop him an email at brennan@planscope.io and let him know that youâ€™r[...]"},"episode-182-or-the-state-of-auditshark":{"title":"Episode 182 | The State of

Iâ€™m Mike.\r\n[00:19] Rob: And Iâ€™m Rob.\r\n[00:20] Mike: And weâ€™re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes weâ€™ve made. How you doing this week, Rob?\r\n[00:24] Rob: Iâ€™m doing good. I feel like the new year is really starting to ramp up and people are back signing up for apps again and itâ€™s exciting.\r\n[00:33] Mike: Yeah, I know what you mean. Thereâ€™s a number of things that were on my list of things to get done last year that never did but they tended to be more of the clean up nature and Iâ€™ve starting to bang through those kind of get them off of my mind and off my plates so that I can work on other things.\r\n[00:46] Rob: Yeah, I had several of those as well. I also finally did my 2-day retreat just to do some thinking. You know, I walked like miles and miles a day and thought and looked at my goals for 2013 and how I wanted to accomplish those and what was going to take. And I looked both at for personal and professional and I just thought through them in-depth. I did mapped them out in quite a bit of detail in a bulleted list and then I put them in to my idea notebook where Iâ€™ll be referencing them throughout the year. It was a really good way to start the year actually. I recommend if you canâ€¦can take even just 24 hours and get away from kind of the hectic nature of your life to really sit down and think about what you want to accomplish in the year. I found it to be pretty valuable.\r\n[01:25] Mike: Cool.\r\n[01:25] Rob: How about you, whatâ€™s going on?\r\n[01:26] Mike: So, Iâ€™m in the middle of finalizing things for releasing AuditShark to someone of my early access customers next week and I plan on giving them to access to everything thatâ€™s been built so far. And Iâ€™ve touched based with the couple of them but not nearly as many as I would like to. So, thatâ€™s something I need to work on a little bit more but fortunately, the contractors that I have doing some of the development work, theyâ€™ve been just concentrating on the technical side of things which freeze up a lot of my time for all the marketing stuff and thatâ€™s going really well right now. Iâ€™m really happy with all thatâ€™s going on. Hopefully, the trend will continue and my previously stated goal, I was thinking about it last night of not doing code. I decided I have to retract that just because I enjoy doing code on occasion. I think kind of touching things on occasion as opposed to digging in and actually trying to solve some of the down or dirty problems.\r\n[02:19] Rob: Yeah, thereâ€™s a big difference between coding on major projects and just hacking your script out because Iâ€™m like you. I canâ€™t get away from the code because I enjoy it too much. I really do love writing good code. It gives your mind a rest if youâ€™re busy thinking about, you know, a lot of other stuff. So you just sit there and code for an hour or two can be pretty enjoyable. So, Iâ€™m with you. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever get away from it and I donâ€™t really, really have the desire to. But getting away from having to do it 10, 20, 30 hours a week, thatâ€™s definitely I can see that as an admirable goal.\r\n[02:50] Mike: Uh huh.\r\n[02:50] Rob: So, other stuffâ€¦other stuff thatâ€™s new with me, is with HitTail I have three small launches plan for the next probably 14 days. We have an info graphic that was ready in December and itâ€™s about long tail SEO, trying to get some Twitter buzz and you know, wherever else it is, you do with an info graphic to generate some interest. And then we integrated with HubSpot which is a pretty big one for us.

Whatâ€™s the word this week, Mike?\r\n[00:29] Mike: Well, Iâ€™m in Canada.\r\n[00:31] Rob: Canada. Vancouver?\r\n[00:32] Mike: Nope. Calgary to be exact.\r\n[00:34] Rob: Awesome. Is it chilly up there?\r\n[00:34] Mike: Not too bad. Itâ€™s about 40â€²s or 50â€²s right now.\r\n[00:38] Rob: Oh cool. Yeah, I got a couple of things I wanted to revisit. I was actually listening to episode 75 which is two episodes ago. And remember we had a question about someone was thinking about starting an idea that with $99 a month and it was catering to retailers with closed out merchandise?\r\n[00:53] Mike: Yeah, I remember that.\r\n[00:55] Rob: And we were kind of butting ideas back and forth about it and I was listening to that I realized why didnâ€™t we suggest to really differentiate because I was trying to think why would this idea any different than Craigslist. Why wouldnâ€™t retail and put the stuff on eBay and the way that he would have to penetrate this market I think would be to hire someone or do it themselves for the first few months. Hire someone to go on site and actually snap the photos and post the stuff for free. And now would be to differentiate or write a new B up to X items per month for 99 bucks and then a B X dollars for each additional one or you could have it to your plan as well. But I just realized that like that could actually be a differentiator, right. The reason they would keep them from putting their stuff on Craigslist or eBay is just purely the labor aspect of it.\r\n[01:39] Mike: Thatâ€™s not a bad idea because then you could charge them to essentially come on site and do that stuff for them but then youâ€™re introducing a labor component on your own side.\r\n[01:48] Rob: I know. Thereâ€™s a lot of manners. I mean it doesnâ€™t scale that well. Itâ€™s definitely not like a super highly scalable business.\r\n[01:55] Mike: You know what? I think you could probably use it to target people who are in the photo industry who are hard up for work and just try and get them to go do this jobs on your behalf and obviously, they have to upload the photos and enter stuff in to your software but you could pay them by the hour and how long could it possibly take to do 25 or 50 items because youâ€™re charging more for more items than, you know, you could certainly use that to judge what your cost are especially in that startup test.\r\n[02:22] Rob: Youâ€™re saying almost like crowd source that like just have a kind of a work force piece may work force out there or job goes out and people can claim it and go do it rather than have someone that you or even a contract that you have on staff. Just kind of have photographers, people who know how to take pictures out, theyâ€™re doing it.\r\n[02:36] Mike: Yeah, a little bit of both. I think initially youâ€™d have to do it yourself or have somebody that you trust do it because then you can kind of work out the bugs in that process and then once youâ€™ve kindly got that down, then you could essentially crowd source that work out to people and then pay them that way.\r\n[02:52] Rob: Right. So, cool. I donâ€™t know if still the economics work in 99 bucks a month but anyways, thatâ€™s just another two cents on that. By the way, people are wondering whether call quality is going to crummy because you have a crappy wireless at the

Whether you have built your first product or you are just thinking about it, I am Rob.\r\n[00:21] Mike: And I am Mike.\r\n[00:23] Rob: And we are here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes weâ€™ve made. If you stick around to the end of the episode we are going to be discussing hiring and managing remote developers in depth. Whatâ€™s going on this week Mike?\r\n[00:35] Mike: The last week I remember you would you had mentioned that Google Adwords issue where if you go in you browse and you search for different things there was a little newsletter popup for somebody to signup directly through the Google Adwords. And I did some research on that and unfortunately itâ€™s in beta but itâ€™s basically just an Adwords extension that they have added on it. I mean they have added a couple of different Adwords extensions over the years and this is just one that is currently in beta. So I couldnâ€™t get much info on it and you know there is a little bit of speculation here and there but it seems to be rather new its only been out there for maybe a moth or so.\r\n[01:10] Rob: Yeah I have never actually seen it in the wild you are the one that stumbled upon it when we were having kind of an offline conversation. Explain to theâ€¦ we didnâ€™t talk about it at all on the podcast last week, explain to the listeners what it is.\r\n[01:20] Mike: So when you go to Google and you do a search for something that Google does is in addition to showing the page search results right underneath well actually its embedded in line with some of the search results that are paid for you will have a just a text field that says â€˜subscribeâ€™. And there is a button off to the side I donâ€™t know whether you can customize the â€˜subscribeâ€™ button or not and you basically it will fill in your email address if you are already logged into Google services. And I will assume that it goes through and you know signs you up for whatever mailing list that they have.\r\n[01:55] Now if I remember correctly it also directly sends your email address to them. I donâ€™t know if there is any sort of double opt in or anything like that but it looked interesting. The one thing I question is whether or not people are going to actively hand out their email address through something on that unless you explicitly say in the text of the Ad that you are giving something away for free and they can only get it if they sign up.\r\n[02:20] Rob:Â Â Â  Yeah itâ€™s got to be a big you are basically selling to them in like what you have 50 characters or something. I mean thatâ€™s like ten words tops you know. So you really have to convince someone to give their email quickly. Itâ€™s not like you have even a sidebar with a little photo or anything like that its just very very tight. So we will see how it goes I think itâ€™s an interesting experiment obviously but itâ€™d be curious to try it out at some point. And its Adwords only I mean you know its kind of a bummer they donâ€™t allow it in the search results. But I am sure they are going to they are not going to allow people to do that they want you to pay for it. Well hey my update the new Hit Tail design is up, itâ€™s live.\r\n[02:56] Mike: Really?\r\n[02:57] Rob:Â Â Â  Yeah, yeas I launched it yesterday. So everyone rush out to hittail.com and check it out, itâ€™s a lot of work. Try to think I didnâ€™t have nearly as many issues as I thought it would once I rolled it live. Because I have I did it kind of a commando launch you know I did not have the massive QA team doing all kinds of monitoring and all of that stuff. I just kind of I knew it worked pretty well and I tested the major functions. I put it up yesterday, I emailed everybody all the active users and said come check out andâ€¦\r\n[03:24] Mike: Cool.\r\n[03:25]

She thought, there must be a service to help people in need get crucial items like food and personal hygiene products, with some amount of transparency. When she couldn't find one, she founded HandUp. The for-profit benefit corporation partners with local charities and city services to get more aid directly to homeless and poor people in San Francisco. People in need - members - join HandUp and can create a personal profile on their website. Donors can read individual stories, or give to people they meet in the city via SMS or from the site. Broome isn't only civically-minded. She's ambitious. With progressively minded technologists in the Bay Area looking for ways to give, a large needy population, and millions of dollars in government aid issued in the form of debit cards, she sees HandUp as a tool to solve homelessness through a for-profit venture. Think: a privately-run Food Stamps or SNAP program. Jason gets excited about tackling the seemingly insurmountable issue of homelessness, and how maybe charity isn't enough.

Advertising and virtual goods. No one knows user numbers. Interesting: 70% of users are women\r\n3:55 - JC what do you think, CA? Is this out of line?\r\n4:05 - CA: Iâ€™ve stopped guessing at valuations. Iâ€™d heard of Snapchat before, but just barely, and because I have kids.\r\n4:35 - JC These things get very big, very quick today.\r\n4:49 - CF: they should take the money and run!\r\n5:30 - When you sold OMGPop, did you feel it was the biggest you could get?\r\n5:48 - CF: We were #1, and where do you go from there? You just go downâ€¦.maybe that large investment from teens, is taking value out of Facebook\r\n6:44 - JC: Chris, having been the editor of Wired for a long time, do you have inner tells on things like that?\r\n7:05 - I was an early user of Twitter, but I was wrong about that. I don't think anyone can tell if itâ€™s sustainable, or if teenage fickleness is going to move on?\r\n7:33 - JC: Spotify is reporting $600M in revenue (vs Pandoraâ€™s). Â What do you think?\r\n7:53 - CA - the licensing deals, itâ€™s got apps on all platforms, itâ€™s a sophisticated cloud service.\r\n8:22 - CF: I use it; I love it. Engineer friends are going to use those subs to explore other opportunities for revenue. Â Video, etc. Extreme brand loyalty to the people who use it.\r\n11:00 - 12:05 - JC: Chris, why did you leave Wired?\r\n12:30 - CA: It boils down to Follow your heart. But I started messing around with Lego Mindstorm with my kids. They werenâ€™t impressed with walking or rolling robots. What if they could fly? They lost interest, but I started a community called DIY Drones. Â The 2007 period is when sensors became super cheap. The community grew; people shared design files. The open source model could build a drone. I was having my kids pack kits into pizza companies.\r\n14:25 - JC: can you describe these? When you think â€œDrone,â€™ you think military drone.\r\n14:45 - CA weâ€™ve had radio controlled aircraft for decades. Shows quadcopter & octocopter. Â They have autopilot, which means they fly themselves. Difference between radio control and UAM and fully autonomous drones. Only been possible over the past few years - smartphone technology.\r\n15:42 - JC: Charles?\r\n"},"how-angellist-is-transforming-startups-and-funding":{"title":"How AngelList is transforming startups and funding","link":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/angellist-syndicates-lean-startup-naval-ravikant/","comments":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/angellist-syndicates-lean-startup-naval-ravikant/#comments","publishDate":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 21:08:54 +0000","description":"<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of AngelList or Naval Ravikant, you&#8217;ll never forget the man or the platform after this interview.

Students can earn certificates, and the company is working toward translating those certificates into course credit, that can be transferred into degree-seeking programs. In the meantime, with keyboard biometrics and detailed logging of each click, Coursera plans to use its troves of data to better understand how people learn. Within 5 years, Koller says, Coursera will have the curriculum of a medium to large university.

I love learning and having great guests. One of the products that I use in my companies, all of my companies is New Relic. New Relic is the most awesome web and mobile app monitoring system. It makes all of your apps so much faster because it monitors to real time user experience. Here, you see it on my screen. I may just pull it up here. You can see the browser load time based upon the page rendering, and the network, and the web application, and the request queuing, and memory cache. How is the database doing? How is Ruby doing? If things are out of whack, and you have a hundred millisecond delay, I get these automatic emails to me, and I just hit reply. The team is on it. I am, \"What's going on?\" You could do code level, app performance, as you see here. Which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute? What percentage of the time? What is the response time like? How much of the CPU we are using? All great stuff to know. This really brings this responsiveness. Remember, Marissa Mayer and all the Google team were, \"Speed is the best feature! Speed is the best feature! If you add speed, you increase usage.\" Increase speed, reduce lag - increase usage. Just make it faster, people use it more. Everybody knows that. It is just 101. But you need to have the tools. And you know what? Leaving in the hands of just a sysadmin, and not having this kind of tools, you need to have a collaborative environment about this. That is what I love about, getting resources to send by email. Everybody can see it. You can obviously monitor server resources too. You can see, \"Oh! This server that is running Ubuntu, gets this much RAM, and this type of CPU. Here is how it is doing. Here is the network I/O card. Maybe something is wrong with a pop. Something is wrong with the router.\" We were going to know quickly. They have got 40k customers, and it includes just everybody: Skullcandy, Spotify, Nike, Zillow, and Vonage. I mean these are the people running very large websites. They are relying on New Relic to keep them optimized. Developers across the spectrum trust their critical performance to New Relic. If you want a super powered visibility into all of your web and mobile apps, sign up today, and you will get a free \"This Week in Startups\" T-shirt. Just go to NewRelic.com/TWIST. When you go to NewRelic.com/TWIST, you just click, and you will get this free fan made T-shirt. It has a samurai sword there. I am always saying,"},"jake-quist-ceo-and-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353":{"title":"Jake Quist CEO & Co-Founder of Zillabyte-TWiST #E353","link":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/jake-quist-ceo-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353/","comments":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/jake-quist-ceo-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353/#comments","publishDate":"Tue, 21 May 2013 21:23:59 +0000","description":"<p>Never miss an episode!

For Hunter Walk and Satya Patel, they wanted to work together again. The friends met at Google in the early 2000s as product managers on AdSense. Hunter joined the YouTube team when Google acquired it, Satya eventually moved on to Twitter, and to become a VC. Yes, they could have retired on those pre-IPO Google stock options.

She thought, there must be a service to help people in need get crucial items like food and personal hygiene products, with some amount of transparency. When she couldn't find one, she founded HandUp. The for-profit benefit corporation partners with local charities and city services to get more aid directly to homeless and poor people in San Francisco. People in need - members - join HandUp and can create a personal profile on their website. Donors can read individual stories, or give to people they meet in the city via SMS or from the site. Broome isn't only civically-minded. She's ambitious. With progressively minded technologists in the Bay Area looking for ways to give, a large needy population, and millions of dollars in government aid issued in the form of debit cards, she sees HandUp as a tool to solve homelessness through a for-profit venture. Think: a privately-run Food Stamps or SNAP program. Jason gets excited about tackling the seemingly insurmountable issue of homelessness, and how maybe charity isn't enough.

Advertising and virtual goods. No one knows user numbers. Interesting: 70% of users are women\r\n3:55 - JC what do you think, CA? Is this out of line?\r\n4:05 - CA: Iâ€™ve stopped guessing at valuations. Iâ€™d heard of Snapchat before, but just barely, and because I have kids.\r\n4:35 - JC These things get very big, very quick today.\r\n4:49 - CF: they should take the money and run!\r\n5:30 - When you sold OMGPop, did you feel it was the biggest you could get?\r\n5:48 - CF: We were #1, and where do you go from there? You just go downâ€¦.maybe that large investment from teens, is taking value out of Facebook\r\n6:44 - JC: Chris, having been the editor of Wired for a long time, do you have inner tells on things like that?\r\n7:05 - I was an early user of Twitter, but I was wrong about that. I don't think anyone can tell if itâ€™s sustainable, or if teenage fickleness is going to move on?\r\n7:33 - JC: Spotify is reporting $600M in revenue (vs Pandoraâ€™s). Â What do you think?\r\n7:53 - CA - the licensing deals, itâ€™s got apps on all platforms, itâ€™s a sophisticated cloud service.\r\n8:22 - CF: I use it; I love it. Engineer friends are going to use those subs to explore other opportunities for revenue. Â Video, etc. Extreme brand loyalty to the people who use it.\r\n11:00 - 12:05 - JC: Chris, why did you leave Wired?\r\n12:30 - CA: It boils down to Follow your heart. But I started messing around with Lego Mindstorm with my kids. They werenâ€™t impressed with walking or rolling robots. What if they could fly? They lost interest, but I started a community called DIY Drones. Â The 2007 period is when sensors became super cheap. The community grew; people shared design files. The open source model could build a drone. I was having my kids pack kits into pizza companies.\r\n14:25 - JC: can you describe these? When you think â€œDrone,â€™ you think military drone.\r\n14:45 - CA weâ€™ve had radio controlled aircraft for decades. Shows quadcopter & octocopter. Â They have autopilot, which means they fly themselves. Difference between radio control and UAM and fully autonomous drones. Only been possible over the past few years - smartphone technology.\r\n15:42 - JC: Charles?\r\n"},"how-angellist-is-transforming-startups-and-funding":{"title":"How AngelList is transforming startups and funding","link":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/angellist-syndicates-lean-startup-naval-ravikant/","comments":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/angellist-syndicates-lean-startup-naval-ravikant/#comments","publishDate":"Tue, 19 Nov 2013 21:08:54 +0000","description":"<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of AngelList or Naval Ravikant, you&#8217;ll never forget the man or the platform after this interview.

Instead, they're showrooms for Google X projects. In other words, party barges. The NSA is still trying to spoil the party, however. The latest revelation from the Washington Post, drawing on documents leaked by Edward Snowden, shows the NSA attacked servers that link up data centers owned by Google and Yahoo. That's on top of limited front-door access the agency has negotiated with internet giants. And the Launch of the Week, brought to you by Bing! Motorola teams up with Phonebloks on modular phones.

Coursera, however, is about human learning. The platform makes classes at the nation's top universities available online, to anyone, for free. Students can earn certificates, and the company is working toward translating those certificates into course credit, that can be transferred into degree-seeking programs. In the meantime, with keyboard biometrics and detailed logging of each click, Coursera plans to use its troves of data to better understand how people learn. Within 5 years, Koller says, Coursera will have the curriculum of a medium to large university.

I love learning and having great guests. One of the products that I use in my companies, all of my companies is New Relic. New Relic is the most awesome web and mobile app monitoring system. It makes all of your apps so much faster because it monitors to real time user experience. Here, you see it on my screen. I may just pull it up here. You can see the browser load time based upon the page rendering, and the network, and the web application, and the request queuing, and memory cache. How is the database doing? How is Ruby doing? If things are out of whack, and you have a hundred millisecond delay, I get these automatic emails to me, and I just hit reply. The team is on it. I am, \"What's going on?\" You could do code level, app performance, as you see here. Which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute? What percentage of the time? What is the response time like? How much of the CPU we are using? All great stuff to know. This really brings this responsiveness. Remember, Marissa Mayer and all the Google team were, \"Speed is the best feature! Speed is the best feature! If you add speed, you increase usage.\" Increase speed, reduce lag - increase usage. Just make it faster, people use it more. Everybody knows that. It is just 101. But you need to have the tools. And you know what? Leaving in the hands of just a sysadmin, and not having this kind of tools, you need to have a collaborative environment about this. That is what I love about, getting resources to send by email. Everybody can see it. You can obviously monitor server resources too. You can see, \"Oh! This server that is running Ubuntu, gets this much RAM, and this type of CPU. Here is how it is doing. Here is the network I/O card. Maybe something is wrong with a pop. Something is wrong with the router.\" We were going to know quickly. They have got 40k customers, and it includes just everybody: Skullcandy, Spotify, Nike, Zillow, and Vonage. I mean these are the people running very large websites. They are relying on New Relic to keep them optimized. Developers across the spectrum trust their critical performance to New Relic. If you want a super powered visibility into all of your web and mobile apps, sign up today, and you will get a free \"This Week in Startups\" T-shirt. Just go to NewRelic.com/TWIST. When you go to NewRelic.com/TWIST, you just click, and you will get this free fan made T-shirt. It has a samurai sword there. I am always saying,"},"jake-quist-ceo-and-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353":{"title":"Jake Quist CEO & Co-Founder of Zillabyte-TWiST #E353","link":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/jake-quist-ceo-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353/","comments":"http://thisweekinstartups.com/jake-quist-ceo-co-founder-of-zillabyte-twist-e353/#comments","publishDate":"Tue, 21 May 2013 21:23:59 +0000","description":"<p>Never miss an episode!
